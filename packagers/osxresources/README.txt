Theochrone installation instructions

1. Be sure that your internect connection is active.
2. A script will download and install everything necessary for Theochrone to work.
	2a. Every software or library already installed will not be downloaded or installed another time.
3. Double-click on a script called `installer.command`
	3a. The installer will check your Python installation. Python should be already present on your computer.
	3b. If Python is missing, the installer will download it (it may be long).
	3c. When the installer will ask you to enter your password, please enter it.
	3d. The installer will download and install the libraries. It may be long. Why not pray for me while waiting?
	3e. The whole list of the libraries can be found in the `requirements.txt`.
4. When the installation is done, you can close the window.
5. To use Theochrone, just double-click on the script `theochrone.command`.

Note: deploy Theochrone on Mac OS is a bit hard. This installer is not the best way to do things. Si you know anybody who has skills in this domain (maybe you?), do not hesitate to send me an email at paucazou@theochrone.fr .
