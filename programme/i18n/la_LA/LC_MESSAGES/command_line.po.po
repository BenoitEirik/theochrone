"Theochrone accepts many formats :\n"
"                  - Nothing : current day\n"
"                  - A complete date with year, month and day of month, for "
"example as following :\n"
"                    - DD MM YYYY\n"
"                    - DD-MM-YYYY\n"
"                    - DD/MM/YYYY\n"
"                    - DDMMYYYY (eight characters required)\n"
"                    - Day in figures, month in letters, year in figures : "
"ex. 30 december 1990 ; 8th july 1990\n"
"                    - weekday before the date as above : ex. Wednesday the "
"24th of January 2017\n"
"                    WARNING !!! The order of these elements much depends on "
"your language.\n"
"                - You can imply one of these elements, and so works "
"Theochrone :\n"
"                    - a figure between 1 and 31 : day of the current month "
"in the current year\n"
"                    - a weekday in letters only : the requested day in the "
"current week (starting with Sunday)\n"
"                    - a month only (ex : july, sept,...) : the complete "
"month of the current year\n"
"                    - the day and the month without year : current year "
"used\n"
"                    - a number between 1600 and 4100 : the complete year.\n"
"                    - a word as listed below in your current language :\n"
"                        - 'week' : the complete current week, starting with "
"Sunday, ending with Saturday. You can also ask for 'next' or 'last' 'week', "
"which returns the week after current, and the past one.\n"
"                        - 'tomorrow' : the day after current one. You can "
"also ask for the 'day after tomorrow'.\n"
"                        - 'yesterday' : the day before current one. You can "
"also ask for the 'day before yesterday'.\n"
"                        - 'next month', or 'previous month', which returns "
"the month after current one, and the month before current one.\n"
"                        - 'next year', or 'previous year', which returns the "
"year after current one, and the year before current one.\n"
